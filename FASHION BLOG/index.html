    <p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite,<br>san the pice tag. But I wasn't so lucky or<br>connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you<br>out. First plan put which shows are most<br> important to you and make a schedule and this is<br>a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won't have<br> fun. Then check out the prices, days, and times and<br>prioritize the designers you want to see most.<br>Lastly, purchase yout tickets and get excited!</p>
    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

    <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you<br>don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time and<br>it will show. Remember, NYFW is about<br>expressing yourself and taking in what the<br>designers have shosen to express through their<br>new lines. ALso it's important to wear shoes you'll<br>be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to<br>look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long,<br>so be prepared.</p>
